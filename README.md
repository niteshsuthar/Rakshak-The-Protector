# Rakshak-The-Protector

Problem Statement: -
An increasingly large number of college-going women taking public transportation in Delhi have resorted to carrying pins, pen knives, and even daggers as a deterrent. Others have taken self-defense classes.
A recent survey revealed that approximately 90 percent of college women in New Delhi have experienced sexual harassment in some shape or form. Yet, it is estimated that only about 1 in 10000 eve teasing occurrences are reported to the police.
In India, eve-teasing affects every woman who dares to come out of her home, in some form or the other. Every woman has a private space. Any person entering her private space causes trouble to her or injures her. It is noticed in all places like Beaches, roads, cinema halls, buses, and educational institutions.

Solution: -

The project consists of Smart Pendant & Smart Shoes or slippers,

Use ESP-NOW Protocol, 
Whenever we press the button on a smart pendant, it will send data to smart slippers,

The smart pendant consists of ESP01, Push Button, Diode & Battery.

Smart slipper consists of a High voltage Generator, ESP01 & Transistor, basically when this ESP01 receives data from Smart Pendant,  A (Transistor)switch is provided on the shoe to start the voltage multiplier circuit which initiates a shock when touched by some person gives a  shock to repel him/her and it can prevent the danger.
